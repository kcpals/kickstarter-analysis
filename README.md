## Overview of Project
Play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. At this time the alysis needed is to see how different campaigns fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals. 
### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
None
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch_Date(path/to/image_name.png)
Outcomes based on launch date show that highest success rates happen in the months of May and June with May being the most successful time to launch a campaign.  Launch dates in December, however, show the lowest success rates which could be contributed to the holidays and shown as not an ideal time for a launch.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
![Outcomes_vs_Goals](path/to/image_name.png)
Goals with lower dollar amounts fared most successful.  For example the highest percentage rate of 75.81% is attributed to goals at less than 1000
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set is limited to plays only
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could also run these analysis on other parent categories to see the differences encountered there, although in this case, we were certainly looking for plays only.
